# Shipgo

Shipgo is a social network that connects Shoppers with Travelers. Shoppers can buy all their needs from all around the world and ship with a Traveler already heading their way. Shoppers save money on shipping, and Travelers make money traveling.

## Features

- **For Shoppers**: Purchase products from anywhere in the world and ship them via Travelers.
- **For Travelers**: Earn money by delivering products on your planned trips.
- **Secure Transactions**: Ensure safe and secure transactions between Shoppers and Travelers.
- **Easy Communication**: Seamless communication between Shoppers and Travelers for coordination.
- **User Reviews**: Build trust through user reviews and ratings.

## How It Works

1. **Sign Up**: Create an account as a Shopper or a Traveler.
2. **Browse Listings**: Shoppers can browse products and Travelers can list their trips.
3. **Match & Connect**: Shoppers find Travelers heading their way, and Travelers find shipping requests.
4. **Transaction**: Agree on terms, make the purchase, and ship the item.
5. **Delivery**: Traveler delivers the item to the Shopper.
